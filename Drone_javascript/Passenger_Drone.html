        <p>
        <em>Drones are used in several sectors for many important functions. In this project a new version of a drone is created; this is a commercial drone which will transport humans and cargo or luggage. These drones will solve several transportation problems, since they are well built to move very fast and to withstand all difficult weather conditions.
<br>
<br>
The most important aspect of these drones is that they are very eco-friendly, this means that they do not release any pollutants such as carbon (IV) oxide and silicon dioxide which deplete the ozone layer into the atmosphere. Hence these commercial drones are less costly, easy to drive, safe and above all eco-friendly.

    <header><b>The future of modern transportation</b></header>
<p>
    The first passenger drone was unveiled on January 6 of 2016 at the international Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Produced by Ethang, a Chinese company based in Guangzhou, the 184 was a one passenger drone equipped with four propellers that could fly for approximately 23 minutes at a top speed of 63 mph.
Passenger drone looks like a small helicopter. The drone runs on electric battery and carries a single passenger weighing up to 100kg at a time. The drone fits the person together with a small backpack, an air condition and a reading light. It gives two commands that’s the take off and land just with a single touch on a tablet. Remote security threats on commercial drone such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack have exposed the vulnerabilities in current drone system. Passenger drone can be very noisy; a single passenger drone such as Joby Aviation’s all-electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft has an estimated noise pollution of 70 db.
Passenger drones can greatly reduce the time travel. As passenger drones flight paths are not restricted by conventional roads, the travel distance is shortened. It can be used for emergency services such as search and rescue missions and the delivery of life saving goods. Companies like Ethang have already begun using passenger drones as emergency vehicles as a response to the potential river bank failure during the flood season in China.

    <header><strong>The problem</strong></header>
    <p>
        Rapid and safe transport is needed in the health sector for transporting patients during emergencies. Rapid transport is also needed in the safety and rescue departments such as the security services and fire service to protect lives and property. Moreover, there is the general need for safe and rapid transport in commercial transport.

Due to lack of safe and rapid transport, all of the above mentioned sectors encounter a lot of difficulties when performing their duties and operations. Therefore, there is the need to find the best solution to all of  these transport problems.
    </p>

<div id="d4" class="hidden">
    <header><strong>Requirements</strong></header>
<p>There is the need to construct an ultramodern mode of transportation which will be very fast, less costly, safe, and convenient to be used in the health, public, security, commercial and rescue sectors.
This mode of transport should be able help to curb the problem of bad roads, loss of human lives due to delay in transporting patients and also help to quickly solve issues relating to fire outbreaks and floods.

    <header><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></header>
<p>Without any doubt, passenger drones have set to change the way humans transport themselves forever. Seriously, this is one welcome idea, considering the number of cars that ply our roads every day. The human population continues to explode and the roads really wouldn’t be able to handle it for long. They are already super-choked. Analysis of such conditions has led to the creation of a passenger drone. The questions stand? Is it safe and how effectively efficient will this drone be? Will it serve its purpose and are there challenges or unexpected outcomes? This evaluation criteria seeks to address all pressing issues ranging from sustainability through to the analysis of the final design.

     <header><em><strong>Model A</strong></em></header>
     <p>This commercial drone consists of four conventional rotary wings(open wing system). Each rotary wing consists of a rotary motor and two rotary blade system each. The drone runs on electrical energy; which makes it  rechargeable .
    This drone flies automatically, the destination only has to be input it’s GPS system. It has a flight time of 23 minutes and a recharge time of 2 to 3 hours. Due to the conventional wing system, this drone has a maximum capacity to carry more load ( about four to five average weight individuals). but at a relatively slow rate.
    
    </p>
    
    <header><em><strong>Model B</strong></em></header>
    <p>This commercial drone consists of four Fenestron rotary wings(closed wing system). Each rotary wing consists of a rotary motor and two rotary blade system each. This drone has a hybrid energy system, it recharges automatically by absorbing solar energy due to it’s dark surface and embedded system of rechargeable solar cells beneath it surface; and it can also be electrically charged for 2 to 3 hours.
    This drone flies automatically, and can also be flown manually. The destination of a passenger can be input into its GPS system. It has an extended period of 30mins after its initial 23 minutes has elapsed. The extended flying time depends on the weather conditions, since the second phase is solar powered. Model B travels relatively faster but carries an average number of load, maximum load is about three average weight individuals.

<header><strong>Conclusion</strong></header>
<p>The commercial drone will help to reduce several problems related to transportation around the world, from bad roads and heavy traffic on high ways. This mode of transportation is fast, and very safe; it will also have no negative effect on our atmosphere and ecosystem at large. It runs on solar and electrical energy so it is very eco-friendly. The Fenestron commercial drone is the best and reliable way of transportation for the future.
