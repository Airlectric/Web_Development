# Passenger Drone 3D CAD Model Website

This repository contains the code for a website showcasing a 3D CAD model of a passenger drone. The website is built using both Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, providing two separate versions of the site.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to create a visually appealing and interactive website to showcase our group's 3D CAD model of a passenger drone. The website allows visitors to view the drone from different angles and explore its features.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Vanilla JavaScript Version**: The Vanilla JavaScript version of the website uses native JavaScript features for interactivity and manipulation of the 3D model.
- **jQuery Version**: The jQuery version of the website utilizes the jQuery library for enhanced interactivity and simplified DOM manipulation.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files each directories:

- **.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the website.
- **css/**: The CSS stylesheets for the website.
- **js/vanilla-js/**: The JavaScript files for the Vanilla JavaScript version.
- **js/jquery/**: A directory containing the JavaScript files for the jQuery version.
- **assets/**: Additional assets used in the website (e.g., images, textures).
